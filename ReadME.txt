The Repository contains helm charts related to the tasks.
The helmcharts for postgres and vault have been downloaded and installed, but I am bringing them here for more information.
nginx's helm chart is located in the directory named helm.
Due to some issues, I used a code ready application to connect to the database and check dynamic access to the database.
Please let me know if you need it demoed.
